# **Text Manipulation Project**
*Written by Roshan Sen*\
*Last Updated 6/28*

## **About**
In order to learn more about computers and practice programming, my goal\
is to recreate the built-in String function in Java in a C environment.\
These methods could potentially be useful in a future project I work on\
as a bioinformatician or computational biologist.

## **Specifications**
The project will have multiple .c files that each contain a function that\
I feel could be useful to recreate in a c environment. I am keeping them\
in separate files for now and will pull from them as needed in the future.

## **Functional Methods**
The to_lowercase method is functional. It is implemented using a large switch\
statement.\
