>>**About**\
My first C project is to build a unit converter. The current\
build allows a user to convert temperature units between Fahrenheit\
and Celcius.\
\
>>**Specifications**\
This project will prompt the user to enter a type of temperature.\
The program will then ask the user to enter a temperature. The program\
will then display the result of the unit conversion.\
\
>>**Status**: Not Functional
